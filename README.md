# Fullstack Test Nested Menu

There is the JSON for a nested menu stored at this url https://formation-media.github.io/fullstack-interview-test/menu.json, you must fetch it from the URL not hardcode it in. 

Once it has been imported you are to create 2 pages:

The first page should display the nested menu (Bonus points for styling)

The second page should allow for editing the menu, you'll need to include the following features:
- Renaming the menu items<br/>
- Changing where in the tree an item is <br/>
- Deleting a menu item<br/>

Ensure the menu is stored on a non volatile storage solution.

You can do this in any language but containerising it is ideal.
