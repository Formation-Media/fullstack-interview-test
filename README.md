# Fullstack Test Nested Menu

There is the JSON for a nested menu stored at this url XXX, you must fetch it from the URL not hardcode it in. 

Once it has been imported you are to create 2 pages:

The first page should display the nested menu (Bonus points for styling)

The second page should allow for editing the menu, you'll need to include the following features:
1) Renaming the menu items
2) Changing where in the tree an item is 
3) Deleting a menu item

Ensure the menu is stored on a non volatile storage solution.

You can do this in any language but containerising it is ideal.
